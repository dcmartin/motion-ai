## Example
<img src="docs/samples/example-motion-detection.gif" width=756>

## Quick Start
Start-to-finish takes about thirty (30) minutes with a broadband connection.  There are [options](docs/OPTIONS.md) to consider; a non-executable example script may be utilized to specify commonly used options.  **Please edit the example [script](config.sh) for your environment**.

The following two (2) sets of commands will install `motion-ai` on the following types of hardware:

+ RaspberryPi Model 3B+ or 4 (`arm`); 2GB recommended
+ Ubuntu18.04 or Debian10 VM (`amd64`); 2GB, 2vCPU recommended
+ nVidia Jetson Nano (`arm64`); 4GB recommended

The initial configuration presumes a locally attached camera on `/dev/video0`.  Reboot the system after completion; for example:

```
sudo apt update -qq -y
sudo apt install -qq -y make git curl jq
git clone http://github.com/dcmartin/motion-ai
cd ~/motion-ai
sudo ./sh/get.motion-ai.sh
sudo reboot
```

When the system reboots install the official MQTT broker (aka `core-mosquitto`) and Motion Classic (aka `motion-video0`) _add-ons_ using the Home Assistant Add-on Store (n.b. Motion Classic add-on may be accessed by adding the repository [http://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons](http://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons) to the Add-On Store.

Select, install, configure and start each add-on (see below).  When both add-ons are running, return to the command-line and start the AI's.  After the MQTT and Motion Classic addons have started, run the `make restart` command to synchroize the Home Assistant configuration with the Motion Classic add-on, for example:

```
cd ~/motion-ai
make restart
```

## Dashboard
Once the system has rebooted it will display a default view; note the image below is of a configured system:

<img src="docs/dashboard.png" width="75%">

## Administrators
A more detailed interface is provided to administrators _only_, and includes both summary and detailed views for the system, including access to **NetData**  and the **motion add-on** Web interface.

<img src="docs/administrators.png" width="75%">

# Add-on's
Install the [MQTT](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/blob/master/mosquitto/README.md) and [Motion Classic](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/blob/master/motion-video0/README.md) _add-ons_ from the **Add-On Store** and configure and start; add the repository [https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons) to the Add-On Store to install Motion Classic.

The Motion Classic configuration includes many options, most which typically do not need to be changed. The `group` is provided to segment a network of devices (e.g. _indoor_ vs. _outdoor_); the `device` determines the MQTT identifier for publishing; the `client` determines the MQTT identifier for subscribing; `timezone` should be local to installation.

**Note:** No capital letters [A-Z], spaces, hyphens (-), or other special characters may be utilized for any of the following identifiers:

+ `group` - The collection of devices
+ `device` - The identifier for the hardware device
+ `name` - The name of the camera

The `cameras` section is a listing (n.b. hence the `-`) and provide information for both the motion detection as well as the front-end Web interface.  The `name`,`type`, and `w3w` attributes are **required**.  The `top`, `left`, and `icon` attributes are _optional_ and are used to locate the camera on the overview image.  The `width`, `height`, and other attributes are _optional_ and are used for motion detection.


#### Example configuration (_subset_)  
```
...
group: motion
device: raspberrypi
client: raspberrypi
timezone: America/Los_Angeles
cameras:
  - name: local
    type: local
    w3w: []
    top: 50
    left: 50
    icon: webcam
    width: 640
    height: 480
    framerate: 10
    minimum_motion_frames: 30
    event_gap: 60
    threshold: 1000
  - name: network
    type: netcam
    w3w:
      - what
      - three
      - words
    icon: door
    netcam_url: 'rtsp://192.168.1.224/live'
    netcam_userpass: 'username:password'
    width: 640
    height: 360
    framerate: 5
    event_gap: 30
    threshold_percent: 2
```

## **AI**'s
Return to the command-line, change to the installation directory, and run the following commands to start the AI's; for example:

```
cd ~/motion-ai
./sh/yolo4motion.sh
./sh/face4motion.sh
./sh/alpr4motion.sh
```

These commands only need to be run once; the AI's will automatically restart whenever the system is rebooted.

## Overview image
The _overview_ image is used to display the location of camera icons specified in the _add-on_ (n.b. `top` and `left` percentages).  The _mode_ may be `local`, indicating that a local image file should be utilized; the default is `overview.jpg` in the `www/images/` directory.  The other modes utilize the Google Maps API; they are:

+ `hybrid`
+ `roadmap`
+ `satellite`
+ `terrain`

The _zoom_ value scales the images generated by Google Maps API; it does not apply to `local` images.

# Composition
The `motion-ai` solution is composed of two primary components:

+ [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io) - open-source home automation system
+ [Open Horizon](http://github.com/open-horizon) - [edge AI](http://github.com/dcmartin/open-horizon)  platform

Home Assistant _add-ons_:

+ [`motion`](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/blob/master/motion-video0/README.md) - _add-on_ for Home Assistant - captures images and video of motion (n.b. [motion-project.github.io](http://motion-project.github.io))
+ [`MQTT`](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/blob/master/mosquitto/README.md) - messaging broker 
+ [`FTP`](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ftp/blob/master/README.md) - optional, only required for `ftpd` type cameras

Open Horizon AI _services_:

+ `yolo4motion` - [object detection and classification](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) 
+ `face4motion` - [face detection](http://github.com/dcmartin/openface) 
+ `alpr4motion` - [license plate detection and classification](http://github.com/dcmartin/openface) 
+ `pose4motion` - [ human pose estimation](http://github.com/dcmartin/openpose)

Data may be saved locally and processed to produce historical graphs as well as exported for analysis using other tools (e.g. time-series database _InfluxDB_ and analysis front-end _Grafana_).  Data may also be processed using _Jupyter_ notebooks.

# What  is _edge AI_?
The edge of the network is where connectivity is lost and privacy is challenged.

Low-cost computing (e.g. RaspberryPi, nVidia Jetson Nano, Intel NUC) as well as hardware accelerators (e.g. Google Coral TPU, Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick v2) provide the opportunity to utilize artificial intelligence in the privacy and safety of a home or business.

To provide for multiple operational scenarios and use-cases (e.g. the elder's _activities of daily living_ (ADL)), the platform is relatively agnostic toward AI models or hardware and more dependent on system availability for development and testing.

An AI's **prediction quality** is dependent on the  _variety_, _volume_, and _veracity_ of the training data (n.b. see [_Understanding AI_](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-ai-david-c-martin/), as the underlying deep, convolutional, neural-networks -- and other algorithms -- must be trained using information that represents the scenario, use-case, and environment; better predictions come from better information.

The Motion &Atilde;&#128065; system provides a _personal AI_ incorporating both a wide variety artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistical models as well as a closed-loop learning cycle (n.b. see [_Building a Better Bot_](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-better-bot-david-c-martin/)); increasing the volume, variety, and veracity of the corpus of knowledge.

# Example: [Age@Home](http://www.age-at-home.com)
This system may be used to build solutions for various operational scenarios (e.g. monitoring the elderly to determine patterns of daily activity and alert care-givers and loved ones when aberrations occur); see the [Age-At-Home](http://www.age-at-home.com/) project for more information; example below:
