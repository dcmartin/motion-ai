#  Motion &Atilde;&#128065;
An open-source software solution for situational awareness from a network of video and audio sources.  Utilizing [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io), [addons](http://github.com/motion-ai/addons), the LINUX Foundation [Open Horizon](http://github.com/open-horizon) edge fabric, and [edge AI services](https://github.com/motion-ai/open-horizon), the system enables _personal_ AI on low-cost devices; integrating object detection and classification into a dashboard of daily activity.

## Example
<img src="docs/samples/example-motion-detection.gif" width=756>

## Quick Start
Start-to-finish takes about thirty (30) minutes with a broadband connection.  There are [options](docs/OPTIONS.md) to consider; a non-executable example script may be utilized to specify commonly used options.  **Please edit the example [script](config.sh) for your environment**.

The following two (2) sets of commands will install `motion-ai` on the following types of hardware:

+ RaspberryPi Model 3B+ or 4 (`arm`); 2GB recommended
+ Ubuntu18.04 or Debian10 VM (`amd64`); 2GB, 2vCPU recommended
+ nVidia Jetson Nano (`arm64`); 4GB recommended

The initial configuration presumes a locally attached camera on `/dev/video0`.  Reboot the system after each step; for example:

```
sudo apt update -qq -y
sudo apt install -qq -y make git curl jq
git clone http://github.com/dcmartin/motion-ai
cd ~/motion-ai
sudo ./sh/get.hassio.sh
sudo reboot
```

```
cd ~/motion-ai
sudo ./sh/get.motion-ai.sh
sudo reboot
```

When the system reboots install the official MQTT broker (aka `core-mosquitto`) and Motion Classic (aka `motion-video0`) _add-ons_ using the Home Assistant Add-on Store.  Select, install, configure and start each add-on (see below).  When both add-ons are running, return to the command-line and start the AI's.

## Add-on's
Install the [MQTT](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/blob/master/mosquitto/README.md) and [Motion Classic](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/blob/master/motion-video0/README.md) _add-ons_ from the **Add-On Store** and configure and start; add the repository [https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons) to the Add-On Store to install Motion Classic.

The Motion Classic configuration includes many options, most which typically do not need to be changed. The `group` is provided to segment a network of devices (e.g. _indoor_ vs. _outdoor_); the `device` determines the MQTT identifier for publishing; the `client` determines the MQTT identifier for subscribing; `timezone` should be local to installation.

The `cameras` section is a listing (n.b. hence the `-`) and provide information for both the motion detection as well as the front-end Web interface.  The `name`,`type`, and `w3w` attributes are **required**.  The `top`, `left`, and `icon` attributes are _optional_ and are used to locate the camera on the overview image.  The `width`, `height`, and other attributes are _optional_ and are used for motion detection.

#### Example configuration (_subset_)  
```
...
group: motion
device: raspberrypi
client: raspberrypi
timezone: America/Los_Angeles
cameras:
  - name: local
    type: local
    w3w: []
    top: 50
    left: 50
    icon: webcam
    width: 640
    height: 480
    framerate: 10
    minimum_motion_frames: 30
    event_gap: 60
    threshold: 1000
  - name: network
    type: netcam
    w3w:
      - what
      - three
      - words
    icon: door
    netcam_url: 'rtsp://192.168.1.224/live'
    netcam_userpass: 'username:password'
    width: 640
    height: 360
    framerate: 5
    event_gap: 30
    threshold_percent: 2
```

## **AI**'s
Return to the command-line, change to the installation directory, and run the following commands to start the AI's; for example:

```
cd ~/motion-ai
./sh/yolo4motion.sh
./sh/face4motion.sh
./sh/alpr4motion.sh
```

These commands only need to be run once; the AI's will automatically restart whenever the system is rebooted.

## &#9937; Warning! Home Assistant v0.116.4
The latest release of Home Assistant _Core_ (v0.117) does **not work** with this software.  The setting of the proper version is performed by the `get.motion-ai.sh` script; to check and manually update the version see below.

```
% ha core info
arch: armv7
...
version: 0.117.0
...
watchdog: true
```

Use the `ha` command to set the Home Assistant version; when completed the system should be operational.

```
% ha core update --version=0.116.4
```

# What  is _edge AI_?
The edge of the network is where connectivity is lost and privacy is challenged.

Low-cost computing (e.g. RaspberryPi, nVidia Jetson Nano, Intel NUC) as well as hardware accelerators (e.g. Google Coral TPU, Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick v2) provide the opportunity to utilize artificial intelligence in the privacy and safety of a home or business.

To provide for multiple operational scenarios and use-cases (e.g. the elder's _activities of daily living_ (ADL)), the platform is relatively agnostic toward AI models or hardware and more dependent on system availability for development and testing.

An AI's **prediction quality** is dependent on the  _variety_, _volume_, and _veracity_ of the training data (n.b. see [_Understanding AI_](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-ai-david-c-martin/), as the underlying deep, convolutional, neural-networks -- and other algorithms -- must be trained using information that represents the scenario, use-case, and environment; better predictions come from better information.

The Motion &Atilde;&#128065; system provides a _personal AI_ incorporating both a wide variety artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistical models as well as a closed-loop learning cycle (n.b. see [_Building a Better Bot_](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-better-bot-david-c-martin/)); increasing the volume, variety, and veracity of the corpus of knowledge.

## Composition
The `motion-ai` solution is composed of two primary components:

+ [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io) - open-source home automation system
+ [Open Horizon](http://github.com/open-horizon) - [edge AI](http://github.com/dcmartin/open-horizon)  platform

Home Assistant _add-ons_:

+ [`motion`](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/blob/master/motion-video0/README.md) - _add-on_ for Home Assistant - captures images and video of motion (n.b. [motion-project.github.io](http://motion-project.github.io))
+ [`MQTT`](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/blob/master/mosquitto/README.md) - messaging broker 
+ [`FTP`](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ftp/blob/master/README.md) - optional, only required for `ftpd` type cameras

Open Horizon AI _services_:

+ `yolo4motion` - [object detection and classification](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) 
+ `face4motion` - [face detection](http://github.com/dcmartin/openface) 
+ `alpr4motion` - [license plate detection and classification](http://github.com/dcmartin/openface) 
+ `pose4motion` - [ human pose estimation](http://github.com/dcmartin/openpose)

## Example
The system provides a default display of aggregated information sufficient to understand level of activity.

<img src="docs/samples/default.png" width="512">

A more detailed interface is provided to administrators _only_, and includes both summary and detailed views for the system, including access to **NetData**  and the **motion add-on** Web interface.

<img src="docs/samples/example.png" width="1024">

Data may be saved locally and processed to produce historical graphs as well as exported for analysis using other tools (e.g. time-series database _InfluxDB_ and analysis front-end _Grafana_).  Data may also be processed using _Jupyter_ notebooks.

### Accelerated hardware 1: nVidia Jetson Nano (aka `tegra`)
In addition to the nVidia Jetson Nano developer kit, there are also the following recommended components:

1. 4 amp power-supply
2. High-endurance micro-SD card; _minimum_: 32 Gbyte; **recommended**: 64+ Gbyte
3. Jumper or wire for enabling power-supply
4. Fan; 40x20mm; cool heat-sink
5. SSD disk; optional; recommended: 250+ Gbyte
