# `ADDONS.md`
There are several community _addons_ which are useful in configuration, management, and functionality.  These addons and many other are available from the **ADD-ON** store in Home Assistant.    Integration between Home Assistant and Open Horizon utilizes both the Home Assistant MQTT broker as well as several custom _addons_, available in another [repository](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/blob/master/README.md), which may be installed using the **Hassio** control panel in the Home Assistant Web UI.

# Addon Store
These addons are available by specifying the repository in the Hassio "ADD-ON STORE" section, for example adding the repository for this site: [`https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons`](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons) will be displayed in the `ADD-ON STORE`:

And when successful the following should appear at the end of the page:

## `motion`
The `motion` add-on processes video information into motion detection JSON events, multi-frame GIF animations, and one representative frame with entities detected, classified, and annotated (n.b. requires Open Horizon `yolo4motion` service).  This addon is designed to work with a variety of sources, including:

+ `3GP` - motion-detecting WebCams (e.g. Linksys WCV80n); received via the `FTP` community _addon_
+ `MJPEG` - network accessible cameras providing Motion-JPEG real-time feed
+ `V4L2` - video for LINUX (v2) for direct attach cameras, e.g. Sony Playstation3 Eye camera or RaspberryPi v2

Visit  [`motion`](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/tree/master/motion) page for details.

## `yolo4motion`
Processes images from the `motion` addon received via MQTT through the [**YOLO**](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) open source object detection and classification deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and publishes results via MQTT.

Visit [`yolo4motion`](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/tree/master/yolo4motion) page for details. 

## `kafka2mqtt4yolo `
The Kafka to MQTT relay for YOLO addon is designed to consume Kafka messages on the topic `yolo2msghub` and produce MQTT messages for consumption by the Home Assistant MQTT broker _addon_.  Visit  [`kafka2mqtt4yolo`](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/tree/master/kafka2mqtt4yolo) page for details. 

## `cpu2msghub`
Collects Kafka messages on topic: `cpu2msghub` and produces MQTT messages for consumption by Home Assistant MQTT `sensor` on `cpu2msghub` topic as `events`.  Visit  [`cpu2msghub`](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/tree/master/cpu2msghub) page for details. 

## `sdr2msghub`
Collects Kafka messages on topic: `sdr/audio` and produces MQTT messages for consumption by Home Assistant MQTT `sensor` on `sdr2msghub` as `events`;  processes spoken audio through IBM Watson Speech-to-text (STT) and Natual Language Understanding (NLU) to produce sentiment and other AI predictions.  Visit  [`sdr2msghub`](https://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons/tree/master/sdr2msghub) page for details. 

# Community Addons

## `Mosquitto`
Provides a local MQTT broker; an MQTT broker is **_required_** to use the `motion` addon

## `Configurator`
Configure Home Assistant through an integrated Web user-interface; more instructions [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/configurator)

## `DNSmasq`
If you want to use the Home Assistant [DNS](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/dnsmasq/) _addon_, the existing DNS resolver for Ubuntu must be disabled.  This method works on Ubuntu Releases 17.04 (Zasty), 17.10 (Artful), 18.04 (Bionic) and 18.10 (Cosmic):

Disable and stop the systemd-resolved service:

```
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
```

Set DNS to `default`

```
sudo echo 'dns=default' >> /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```

Delete  /etc/resolv.conf

```
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
```

Restart network-manager

```
sudo service network-manager restart
```
