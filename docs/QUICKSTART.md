# `QUICKSTART.md`
This _quick start_ is suitable for the following:

+ Ubuntu 18.04 systems on `amd64` and `aarch64` (e.g. nVidia Jetson Nano)
+ Rasbian Buster on `armv7` (e.g. RaspberryPi models 3 & 4).

## Step 1: Setup device
Download OS image and flash SD card using [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

### A. Operating Systems
These installation instructions have only been tested on Rasbian 32bit.

+ Raspberry Pi OS [32-bit](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf/images/raspios_lite_armhf-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip)

Future:

+ Raspberry Pi OS [64bit](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2021-05-28/2021-05-07-raspios-buster-arm64.zip)
+ Debian 11 (Bullseye) [64bit](https://raspi.debian.net/tested/20210823_raspi_3_bullseye.img.xz)
+ Ubuntu 20.04.03 LTS [64-bit](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/20.04.3/release/ubuntu-20.04.3-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz)

### B. Home Assistant requirements

```
    Docker CE >= 19.03
    Systemd >= 239
    NetworkManager >= 1.14.6
    AppArmor == 2.13.x (built into the kernel)
    Debian Linux Debian 11 aka Bullseye (no derivatives)
    Home Assistant OS-Agent (Only the latest release is supported)

```

### B. Image modifications
Modify the flashed file-system image

#### Rasbian
Specify a WiFi SSID and pre-shared key (PSK) in the `/wpa_supplicant.conf` file, typically mounted in `/Volumes/boot` on macOS; for example:

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
network={
  ssid="<YOUR_SSID>"
  psk="<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

#### Debian 11

Specify a hostname and a public `ssh` key to enable remote, headless, access to the device.  The file is typically mounted at `/Volumes/RASPIFIRM/sysconf.txt`

Uncomment the line with `root_authorized_keys` with the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file.

```
root_authorized_key=ssh-rsa <YOUR KEY> you@yourhost
```
Uncomment the line with `hostname` with the desird name, for example:

```
hostname: motion-ai
```

### C. Boot and access

Eject uSD card from the host computer, insert into device, attach ethernet cord, and provide power.
  
Access device using `ssh`

#### Raspbian (password: `raspberry`)
```
ssh <ip> -l pi
```

#### Debian 11
```
ssh <hostname>.local -l root
```

#### Ubuntu 20.04 (password: `ubuntu`)
```
ssh <ip> -l ubuntu
```

### D. Base components
Update software repositories and install base programs (as **root**).

```
apt update -qq -y
apt install -qq -y curl wget jq sudo git make gettext
```

### E. Setup WiFi connectivity (optional)

```
SSID=<yourwifi-name>
PSK=<yourwifi-password>
nmcli dev wifi connect ${SSID} password ${PSK}
```

## Step 2: Copy repository
Clone the repository into the target Home Assistant directory, for example:

```
git clone http://github.com/dcmartin/motion-ai /usr/share/hassio
ln -s /usr/share/hassio ~/motion-ai
cd motion-ai
```

## Step 3: Install Docker
Install Docker-CE (community edition) with the following command:

```
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh
```

## Step 4: Install Home Assistant
See the [instructions](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer) to install Home Assistant in a supervised configuration; TL/DR, do the following:

### A. Pre-requisite software
To install Home Assistant there are a number of prerequisite software packages; install using the following:

```
apt install -qq -y udisks2 libglib2.0-bin dbus apparmor apparmor-utils network-manager
```

Then modify the LINUX `/boot/cmdline.txt` file to include AppArmor parameters; for example:

```
console=tty1 <deleted> apparmor=1 security=apparmor lsm=apparmor
```

### B. OS Agent
The [Agent for Home Assistant OS](https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent/tree/main#using-home-assistant-supervised-on-debian) provides services for the host OS.

Download the appropriate architecture package and install.

For example for `aarch64` (i.e. RaspberryPi 64bit on Debian 11 or Rpi4 on Rasbian 64bit):

```
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent/releases/download/1.2.2/os-agent_1.2.2_linux_aarch64.deb
dpkg -i os-agent_1.2.2_linux_aarch64.deb
```

Or `armv7` (_aka_ `armhf`, i.e. RaspberryPi3B+ on Rasbian 32bit):

```
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent/releases/download/1.2.2/os-agent_1.2.2_linux_armv7.deb
dpkg -i os-agent_1.2.2_linux_armv7.deb
```

The installation will prompt for end-user specification of architecture (DAMW)

### C. Home Assistant
Install the supervised version of Home Assistant with all its friends using the Debian package; suitable for all architectures.

```
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer/releases/latest/download/homeassistant-supervised.deb
dpkg -i homeassistant-supervised.deb
```

Installation may be verified by visiting the server on the [host at port 8123](http://localhost:8123/).

## Step 5: Install Add-Ons
Additional Home Assistant _add-ons_ are utilized for handling cameras ([Motion Classic](https://github.com/motion-ai/addons/blob/master/motion-video0/README.md)), routing messages ([MQTT]()), and capturing uploaded files ([FTP]()).

### A. MQTT
The standard _add-on_ is available in built-in catalog.  Visit the **Supervisor** panel item and view the app store.

### B. Motion Classic
This _add-on_ is in an external [catalog](http://github.com/dcmartin/hassio-addons) that must be added as a new **repository** in the app store.

### C. FTP (optional)
A basic FTP server is provided in the built-in community add-on catalog.  Visit the **Supervisor** panel item and view the app store.

## Step 6: Configure Motion Ã👁

### A. Configure

Configuration [options](OPTIONS.md) are specified through environment variables and/or local files with the same name.  There is a sample script [`config.sh`](../config.sh) which can be changed to meet local conditions.  Configuration may also be specified manually, for example some important ones include:

```
echo 80 > HOST_PORT
echo username > MOTIONCAM_USERNAME
echo password > MOTIONCAM_PASSWORD
echo username > NETCAM_USERNAME
echo password > NETCAM_PASSWORD
echo 192.168.1.50 > MQTT_HOST
```

### B. Install

Run the installation script; it will download additional containers for the entity, face, and license plate AI's as well as model weights where appropriate.

```
./sh/get.motion-ai.sh
```

### C. Restart
